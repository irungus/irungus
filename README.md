Samuel Irungu has been a Data Scientiest Enthusiast since 2013 after Graduating from Maasai Mara University with a Bachelors of Science in Apllied Statistics with Computing. 
Since then i have worked on many projects as an analyst and in the Public Sector in the Kenyas Devolved units as a research in the field of Health, Agriculture, Land and Physical Planning, Early Childhood Education, Vocational Training and on County Budgeting. In 2021 i resolved to get my hands dirty by kickstarting my re-entry in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science so as to offer solutions to the downtrodden masses of the Kenyans population leaving in the rural areas. Am hoping to scale up my solutions through Machine Learning and Data Science application to the African continent.
